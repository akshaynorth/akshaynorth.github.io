# Anthony Aneke's Code Institute Milestone Project 1

## Introduction and Purpose
IP Attache is a user-centric frontend website that offers intellectual property services to clients in Life sciences, Engineering, Service industry and Electronics and computing 
for those inoventors and innovators looking to commercialize their idea to products.
This website is a full-service intellectual property law company with the competence in patents, litigation, and design.

## UX design
Leveraged CSS Bootstrap for mobile first user experience. responsive site. It also contains avaScript-based design templates for forms, typography, and other interface components.
The UX process was an iterative method which I improved upon to ensure it was user-friendly to the audience of the website. 

## User story
As a user type, I want to performbe able to access IP Attache to view and order their services. Their services agnostics of their services provide the required due-dillegence patent our ideas and eventually commercialize them 

## Features
The "Homepage" page descirbes: an overview of the entire website. 
The "About Us" includes the vision and mission of the webite as well as the leadership profile.
THe "Practice area" includes all the services of rhe website.
The "Get in touch" page is for users tto contact IP Attache.
The site map details the list of pages and different sectios onf the IP Attache website i.e. Business hours, contact details 

## Existing Features
IP Attache plans to scale this webite to include more features utilizing javascript to create interactive effects within web browsers.

## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS libraries/frameworks such as Bootstrap 4 

## Future technology 
This project will use JQuaery library to simplify DOM manipulation for future projects. 

## Testing implementation
I set up a test environment (Light-weight http server) that served the webpages to be tested. I did static testing and visual inspection to make sure content was rendered as designed, I executed system testing to make sure use cases worked in accordance to design intent.  
Essentially, I went through all user story and all functions passed.

Some manual test steps that were executed 
Go to the "About Us" page
Try to click on the link and verify that you are navigated to the right page. This is a passed test.

Go to the "Get in touch" page 
Try to submit the form with your email address and verify you did not recieve any message. This is a passed test.

Go to the "Free consultation" page 
Try to click on it and verify that nothihg happens. This is a passed test.

Please note the Get in touch and Free consultation page will be function in the interactive front-end milestone project.
I had a few bugs from the w3c validators, extra html tags (closing htmls (they did not have a matching opening html elemnt) that were not supposed to be there - This was fixed. 
Bugs were detected from Formatting Typos - This was fixed
Bugs were detected from Broken images bugs and links - This was fixed
Bugs were detected from broken hyperlinks - This was fixed
Vimeo video from website template considered a bug - This was fixed.  

## Deployment implementation
I utilized Github pages service to make website available. 

## Deployment write-up
I copied my private repo (user_centric_frontend) into the akshaynorth.github.io public repo, resulting in making the ipattache website available through the Git hub pages

## The publically available website link
https://akshaynorth.github.io

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files? Not Applicable
Separate git branch? Not Applicable 
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

##	Navigation
It is my believe this website contains apposite navigation for users

## Ease of use
It is my believe this website provides ease of use for its customers.

## Information Architecture
It is my believe this website meets the standard structural and behavioral design criteria 

## Layout and Visual Impact:
Responsive Design – I tested the site response in multiple simulated devices (tablets and mobile) and the website responded by adjusting its layout to the simulated screen sizes.
Image Presentation
Colour scheme and typography
## Software Development practices:
Directory Structure and File Naming – I went through systematic approach to develop a naming convention. After establishing this, I created html files for each website page as well as naming the  pages to correspond to the top menu bar drop down. 

## Version control
Git was used for version control. I incrementally and iteratively staged, committed, and pushed new or modified all changes during the implementation of the website

## Testing write-up
I tested all the links to make sure there was no broken links.
Visual inspection was executed for typos and a proper display of html elements. 
System Test was executing to make sure dropdown pages were rendered in accordance to design intent. 

## Readme file
Confirmed

## Code Template Credits
For the development of this milestone project 1 a website template was employed. 
The template contains a set of HTML, CSS (Bootstrap4), JavaScript files that can be
altered as needed. The code was downloaded from the following website::

    https://themewagon.com/

The site contains a collection of  free and paid templates. For this assignent, I
choosed the *Legal Care* webiste template. The chosen website template can be found
at::
